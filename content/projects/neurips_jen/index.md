## My Voice, Your Voice, Our Voice: Attitudes Towards Collective Governance of a Choral AI Dataset

**Author:** Jen Ding

As part of the Creativity & AI Workshop at NeurIPS 2024, a 
[paper on the Choral Data Trust Experiment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01433)
as part of the Holly Herndon at Mat Dryhurst exhibition at Serpentine,
["The Call"](https://www.serpentinegalleries.org/whats-on/holly-herndon-mat-dryhurst-the-call/) (2024-2025).

The paper explores the opportunity to expand collective governance opportunities for datasets beyond
individual opt in/out to enable a more empowering future for creatives in the generative AI ecosystem.
