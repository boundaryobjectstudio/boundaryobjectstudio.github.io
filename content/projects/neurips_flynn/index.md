## Toward Democracy Levels for AI

**Author:** Flynn Devine

As part of the Pluralistic Alignment workshop at NeurIPS 2024, a 
[paper proposing a "Democracy Levels" framework ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09222)
for evaluating the degree to which decisions in a given domain are made democratically. 
The framework can be used (i) to define milestones in a roadmap for the democratic AI, pluralistic AI, 
and public AI ecosystems, (ii) to guide organizations that need to increase the legitimacy of their 
decisions on difficult AI governance questions, and (iii) as a rubric by those aiming to 
evaluate AI organizations and keep them accountable.
