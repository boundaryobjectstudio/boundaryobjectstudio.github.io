Boundary object: &ldquo;information, such as specimens, field notes, and maps, used in different ways by different communities for collaborative work through scales.&rdquo;
Innovation does not only happen within institutions.
More than ever, some of the best innovations are developed by independent
researchers, builders, and activists across disciplines,
organisational boundaries and geographic borders.
Boundary Object Studio is a home for individual innovators to share knowledge,
collaborate, and build towards a common aim of enabling a future with AI
that can benefit more people and communities around the world."/>

<p>We seek to incubate ideas, initiatives and communities across borders and
boundaries, particularly those that enable new <strong>boundary objects</strong> to emerge.</p>
<p>We operate as a distributed collective,
connecting our individual ideas and discoveries in a common space
towards our common mission.</p>
